	<p id='title'>So you want to start longboarding?</p>
	<p> Here are a few helpful hints</p>
	<h4>1. Picking a Board for Longboarding</h4>
	<p>	Shorter boards will allow you to turn sharper and are more agile, but they don't offer much stability and 
		as you increase your speed the board often begins to wobble. while a longer board offers that stability for increased
		speed it is difficult to get sharp turns.</p>
	<h4>2. Picking Your Wheels</h4>
	<p>There are a few more decisions to make before you can ride your board, we will start with wheels</p> 
	<p>If you you are looking strictly for speed than the larger wheels will be great for you, 
		however they do have a tendency to have slower acceleration. Also wheel hardness makes a huge difference to the 
		performance of the board. While the wheels will last longer if they are hard, they will be less stable and rough 
		surfaces can be difficult to ride on.</p>
	<h4>3. Get Your Other Gear Together</h4>
	<p>While you may not like the look of protective gear, it will really help especially as you are learning to ride.
		There are a few certainties associated with longboarding but one of them is that you will fall, having the right 
		gear will help make sure you can get back up and try again.</p>
